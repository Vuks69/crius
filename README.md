# Crius

Univeristy project, aiming at creating an universal infratructure and service inventory and management tool.

## Usage

    sudo python arp-scan.py [interface]
    python nmap.py <address/network> [minimal|full]
    python ssh.py

## Goals

Consolidate SNMP, CDP, LLDP and script automation via SSH into a simple, easy to use tool that anyone can utilize.

## Testing

Will be likely done through orchestrating a large network of containers and services via docker-compose, and running Crius there.

## Trivia

### Crius

The Titan god of **constellations**. His name in Greek means “ram” and it shows his connection with the constellation Aries.

### Notable mentions

Lansweeper, network inspector/infrastructure
